Dex-Pump, an Oklahoma City based startup company, is seeking an operator in the OK Mississippian Play to test their innovative pump.

The Dex-Pump extends the life of mature rod pumped horizontal wells by extending the pumping system intake deep into the curve removing backpressure on the reservoir.

The Dex-Pump system attaches to the bottom of a conventional rod pumping system and uses a bladder pump located at the end of 2 3/8’ riser tubing (~500’) to move fluid from the bottom of the curve. 

The power fluid for the Dex-Pump is compressed air which operates the bladder pump via capillary tubing attached to the outside of the production tubing and riser tubing. 


## Candidates

- 7” production casing to the top of the curve
- Oil cut above 50% and/or high GOR 
- Current total fluid rate below 50 bpd
- Electric motor driven pumping unit with POC
- Single digit decline rate
- Low failure rate well
